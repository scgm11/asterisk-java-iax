how to compile: 
  mvn clean install

how to self-sign the jar: 

 keytool -genkey -keystore keystore_file -alias jdc
 
 jarsigner -keystore keystore_file file_to_sign.jar jdc
 
 (or maybe use some maven magic)

note to self:
 
  this applet will be able to share 
  device audio with other application 
  on a linux machine only if you use 
  java 1.7 plugin. prev version don't 
  work with pulseaudio and want to access 
  the device audio in exclusive mode. 

  openjdk don't work well, choppy audio, 
  missing frame, mr roboto...
